Python code to play "10 Thousand" dice game. 
* Objective  
- First person to get to 10,000 points wins the game. 
* Rules
- To start tallying up your points you must first have a single turn where you earn more than 500 points. 
- Start your turn by rolling all five dice
  - Add up all of your points according to the list below.
  - If you roll a 1 or a 5 you may roll again but must remove at least one of the dice that rolled a 1 or a 5 (these removed dice are still added to your score)
  - If you roll the dice and there are no scoring combinations, then you lose all of the points that you have acccumulated and you end your turn adding 0 to your score for this round.
  - If all of your rolled dice are scoring combinations then you may keep your existing score and reroll all 5 dice, this score will be added to your previous score and you may continue from step 1. 
* Points
- A roll of 1 for 100 points each
- A roll of 5 counts for 50 points each
- A roll of three of the same number (within the same roll) counts for 100 times the number on the die, except for three ones which count for 1000. 
- A straight of 5 dice counts as 1000.
